There is no doubt that typing on a keyboard is an essential skill in the digital age. Typing fast and accurately gives you more opportunities, more time for what matters to you, and a sense of self-accomplishment.

Keypunch lets you practice typing. Thanks to fast-paced sessions with instant feedback afterwards and a plethora of available languages, you might even have a little fun doing so. With determination, proper technique and some time, you will experience a noticeable increase in both the speed and the accuracy of which your thoughts and ideas are put into words on the screen.

If you are already a racer at typing, Keypunch still has something for you. Try practicing with numbers and punctuation, or choose your own text to type out as fast as you can.

Get ready to accelerate your typing!

## Name

In addition to sounding neat, "Keypunch" is the name of an [actual keyboard device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch) used for creating punched cards. It might have gone out of fashion, but the fun of typing has not!

## Roadmap

- Caps Lock indication
- Logging of typing speed/accuracy over time, and a nice statistics dialog 
  to view / export these statistics
- Break reminders (displayed after sessions if the app has been continuously 
  in use for a long time, to avoid finger strain)
- Frustration relief (stop the session and suggest taking a break when people 
  are obviously mashing keys randomly in frustration)
- Practice mode / typing guide (?)
- Local-first p2p multiplayer mode (?)
